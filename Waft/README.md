# Waft
A few days ago, I was in my home, trying to repair a radiator. And I was inspecting a piece of the radiator that was broken like this:

And in internet doesn't appreared the website of the vendor. So I thought it was a nice opportunity to start an OSINT invesigation easily.

First of all, I tried to find the website of the vendor, Waft.
![waft search](https://github.com/n4s3r/OSINT-investigations/assets/145504084/2bc7e7d0-b42f-4af4-abf8-7d3cda1a5afc)

You can see in the image, in the right, down, there's a website: www.waftcontrol.com.
So I tried to connect to that website, but didn't work:
![waft domain](https://github.com/n4s3r/OSINT-investigations/assets/145504084/e58e5d1b-d7d6-4c6c-97e3-bb145c5fb8dc)

That didn't work because doesn't exists www.waftcontrol.com:
![DNS resolver](https://github.com/n4s3r/OSINT-investigations/assets/145504084/24896080-6229-4d0d-8bab-f05e03ebea3e)

So I tried to search more information using google dorks. My idea is gather information about the website when it existed. But didn't work:
![dorks search 1](https://github.com/n4s3r/OSINT-investigations/assets/145504084/b4c0070e-b5f1-41ca-b208-f20479baa806)

I tried to use another dorks like this, but It didn't work:
![dorks search 2](https://github.com/n4s3r/OSINT-investigations/assets/145504084/4af2f814-7fa2-464e-be3a-bd856cb450e0)

To try to end this, I searched the domain "www.waftcontrol.com" in archive.org. The last copy of the website, was in 2021:
![archive.org 1](https://github.com/n4s3r/OSINT-investigations/assets/145504084/e11f08c5-11aa-4bee-97d6-795342395799)

And I could find the copy of the website that I was looking for:
![archive.org 2](https://github.com/n4s3r/OSINT-investigations/assets/145504084/9c21d985-af66-43bd-9c41-9d9eea930670)
